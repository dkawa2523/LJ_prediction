Using S90_artifacts_versioning + S95_tests_ci to align the artifact contract and contract tests.

**Status**
- Task 020 is blocked per `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md` because run/output dir conventions are not finalized.
- `work/queue.json` shows 010/015 done, but the task file is the source of truth; I need confirmation to proceed.
- Environment is read-only, so I cannot edit files or update `work/queue.json`.

**Change Plan (File-Level)**
- `src/utils/artifacts.py`: add artifact save helpers and hash utilities for config/meta/metrics/model/predictions.
- `scripts/train.py`: call artifact saver to write `config.yaml`, `meta.json`, `metrics.json`, `model.ckpt` (plus preprocess/featurizer state if present).
- `scripts/predict.py`: save `predictions.csv` and write meta with `model_version`, `run_id`, `dataset_hash`, etc.
- `tests/contract/test_artifacts_contract.py`: add contract checks for required files and `meta.json` keys.

**Implementation (Diff)**
- N/A — blocked and read-only.

**Tests Added/Updated**
- N/A — blocked.

**Verification Command**
- Once unblocked: `pytest tests/contract -k artifacts`

**Compatibility Impact (Config/CLI/Artifact)**
- None yet. Planned changes add required artifacts per `docs/04_ARTIFACTS_AND_VERSIONING.md` without CLI/config changes.

**Queue Status**
- Should update `work/queue.json` task 020 to `blocked` with the reason from the task file; I can’t edit it in read-only mode.

Please confirm whether 010/015 are considered complete and whether I should proceed with Task 020 now. If yes, I’ll need write access to update files and `work/queue.json`.
