Using S90_artifacts_versioning and S95_tests_ci to confirm artifact/test requirements.

No code changes; task 020 is blocked per `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md` (output dir standardization not fixed yet), and this session is read-only so I can’t update files like `work/queue.json`.

**Change Plan**
- Blocked. If unblocked, plan to edit `src/utils/artifacts.py`, `scripts/train.py`, `scripts/predict.py`, and add tests under `tests/contract/`.

**Implementation**
- No changes (blocked + read-only).

**Tests**
- Not run.

**Verification Command**
- `pytest -q tests/contract` (once unblocked).

**Compatibility Impact**
- None (no changes).

**work/queue.json**
- Not updated due to read-only; current `work/queue.json` shows task 020 as `in_progress`.

Next steps:
1) Confirm whether 010/015 are truly complete and update `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md` to remove the Blocked section (or clarify the remaining blocker).
2) Re-run this task with write permissions so I can implement the artifacts + contract tests and update `work/queue.json`.
