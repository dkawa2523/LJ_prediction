Using S90_artifacts_versioning and S95_tests_ci because this task is about artifact contracts and contract tests.

Task 020 is blocked per `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md`, so I didn’t make code changes. Also, I can’t update `work/queue.json` in this read‑only sandbox.

**Change Plan (once unblocked)**
- `src/utils/artifacts.py`: add shared save helpers for config/meta/metrics/predictions/model.
- `scripts/train.py`: call helpers to persist `config.yaml`, `meta.json`, `metrics.json`, `model/model.ckpt`.
- `scripts/predict.py`: write `predictions.csv` and update `meta.json` with model_version.
- `tests/contract/`: add contract tests for required files/keys per `docs/04_ARTIFACTS_AND_VERSIONING.md`.

**Implementation**
- No changes; task is blocked.

**Tests**
- No tests added/updated.

**Verification**
- Not run; would be `pytest -q tests/contract`.

**Compatibility Impact**
- None (no changes).

**Queue Status**
- Required update: set task 020 to `blocked` in `work/queue.json`. I can’t edit it in read‑only mode.
- Note: `work/queue.json` currently shows task 020 as `in_progress`, while `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md` says blocked.

If you want me to proceed now that 010/015 are done, please either:
1) Update `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md` to remove the Blocked section (or mark it unblocked), and rerun with write access, or  
2) Make the updates yourself and tell me to continue.
