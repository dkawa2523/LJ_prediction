Using skills: S90_artifacts_versioning and S95_tests_ci to confirm artifact contract + contract test expectations.

The task file `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md` marks this work as blocked until the output directory/Process conventions are fixed, so I did not make any changes.

**Change Plan**
- Blocked by task definition; no file changes planned until unblocked.

**Implementation**
- No changes made; no diff (task blocked).

**Tests**
- None added/updated.

**Verification**
- Not run (blocked).

**Compatibility Impact**
- None.

**Queue Status**
- `work/queue.json` should be updated to set task `020` to `blocked` with the reason from `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md`, but I can’t edit files in the current read-only sandbox.

If you want me to proceed, please do one of these:
1) Mark task 020 unblocked in `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md` (and optionally `work/queue.json`), then rerun me.
2) Switch to a write-enabled sandbox so I can update `work/queue.json` and implement the artifact contract.
