Using S90_artifacts_versioning + S95_tests_ci to align artifact contract and contract tests.

**Status**
- `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md` marks this task blocked pending 010/015; per contract I’m not implementing changes yet.
- `work/queue.json` shows 010/015 as done; this conflicts with the task file—please confirm how to proceed.

**Change Plan (File-Level)**
- Blocked: no edits until unblocked. If you want me to proceed, I’ll target `src/utils/artifacts.py`, `scripts/train.py`, `scripts/predict.py`, and `tests/contract/`.

**Implementation (Diff)**
- None; no code changes while blocked.

**Tests Added/Updated**
- None.

**Verification Commands**
- None.

**Compatibility Impact**
- None (no changes).

**Queue Status**
- I couldn’t update `work/queue.json` because the session is read-only and approvals are disabled.

Next steps:
1) Confirm you want me to proceed despite the block in the task file.  
2) Update the task file/queue to unblock and rerun with write access.
