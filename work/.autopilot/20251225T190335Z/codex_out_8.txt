Using S90_artifacts_versioning and S95_tests_ci because this task is about artifact contract implementation and contract tests.

**Change Plan**
- Blocked per `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md`; no file edits until 010/015 unblock is cleared in the task file.

**Implementation**
- No changes; task file explicitly marks this task as blocked.

**Tests**
- None added/updated.

**Verification**
- N/A (blocked). If unblocked later: `pytest tests/contract`

**Compatibility Impact**
- None (no changes).

**Task Status**
- Source of truth `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md` says blocked (010/015 not completed), so I cannot proceed.
- `work/queue.json` still shows task 020 as in_progress, but I can’t update it due to read-only sandbox.
- There is a mismatch: `work/queue.json` shows 010/015 done, while the task file still blocks 020. Please confirm which to follow.

If you want me to move forward, please choose:
1) Update `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md` to remove the block (or tell me to do it once write access is allowed).  
2) Allow write access so I can set `work/queue.json` task 020 to `blocked` (or proceed with implementation if unblocked).
