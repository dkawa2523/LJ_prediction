Using skills S90_artifacts_versioning and S95_tests_ci because this task is about artifact contracts and contract tests.

Task 020 is blocked per `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md`, so I made no code changes. Note: `work/queue.json` shows 010/015 as done, which conflicts with the task file’s blocked reason—please confirm whether the task is now unblocked and the output-dir standard is fixed.

**Change Plan**
- `src/utils/artifacts.py` add shared artifact save helpers (deferred until output dir spec is confirmed)
- `scripts/train.py` call artifact save for config/meta/metrics/model (deferred)
- `scripts/predict.py` save predictions + meta fields like model_version (deferred)
- `tests/contract/test_artifacts_contract.py` add contract checks for required files/keys (deferred)

**Implementation**
- No changes (blocked by task file).

**Tests**
- None added or updated.

**Verification**
- Not run.

**Compatibility Impact**
- None (no changes).

**Queue Status**
- Intended update: set task 020 status to `blocked` in `work/queue.json` with the reason from `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md`.
- I can’t edit `work/queue.json` due to read-only sandbox; please update it manually or allow write access.

Next steps
1) Confirm whether 010/015 are truly complete and the output directory/namespace convention is fixed; if yes, unblock task 020 in `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md`.
2) Let me know the finalized artifact output path pattern (or point to the doc/update), so I can implement the contract functions.
3) If you want me to update `work/queue.json`, please run with write access or update it yourself and tell me once it’s done.
