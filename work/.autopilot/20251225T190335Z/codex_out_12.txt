Using S90_artifacts_versioning → S95_tests_ci because this task is artifact contract + contract tests.

**Status**
- `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md` still marks the task blocked (run dir standardization), so per the task rules I did not implement changes.
- Sandbox is read-only, so I can’t update files like `work/queue.json` even to mark the task blocked.

**Change Plan (file-level, once unblocked)**
- `src/utils/artifacts.py`: add helpers to compute `config_hash`/`dataset_hash` and write contract outputs (`config.yaml`, `meta.json`, `metrics.json`, `model.ckpt`, `predictions.csv`).
- `scripts/train.py`: call the artifact helper after backend training to normalize outputs into the contract layout under the run dir.
- `scripts/predict.py`: call the artifact helper to emit `predictions.csv` and meta (including `model_version`, `run_id`, `upstream_artifacts`).
- `tests/contract/test_artifacts_contract.py`: add contract tests for required files/keys/columns.

**Implementation (diff)**
- Not performed (blocked + read-only sandbox).

**Tests**
- Not added.

**Verification**
- Not run.

**Compatibility Impact**
- None (no changes).

**Queue Update**
- Not updated due to read-only sandbox; `work/queue.json` should set task `020` to `blocked` with the reason from `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md`.

Queue already shows 010/015 done; should I proceed with unblocking task 020 and implement now (requires write access), or keep it blocked until you update the task file?

If you want me to proceed:
1) Unblock task 020 in `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md` and `work/queue.json`.
2) Rerun with write access so I can apply the code/test changes.
