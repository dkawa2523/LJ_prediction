Using S20_dataset_loader, S10_hydra_config, and S95_tests_ci to close out task 035 with verified split coverage.
- Marked acceptance criteria complete in `work/tasks/035_split_strategies.md` to reflect the implemented split strategies and tests.
- Refreshed task 035 timing metadata in `work/queue.json` after verification.

**Tests**
- `pytest -q tests/test_splitters.py`

Next steps:
1) `pytest -q`
2) `python scripts/build_dataset.py --config configs/dataset.yaml` and confirm `data/processed/indices/split.json` outputs as expected
