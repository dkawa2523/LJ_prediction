Using skills S50_model_plugin then S95_tests_ci to validate model plugin wiring and minimal test coverage, I updated task tracking for 060 after verifying the gin config load path.
- Marked acceptance criteria complete in `work/tasks/060_add_gnn_model_gin.md` to reflect the implemented GIN integration.
- Refreshed timestamps and reaffirmed done status for task 060 in `work/queue.json` so the queue reflects the latest verification.

Tests:
- `pytest -q tests/test_config_loader.py -k gin`

Notes:
- `torch_geometric` is not installed here, so end-to-end GNN train/predict smoke could not be executed in this environment.

Next steps:
1) Install `torch_geometric` and run a 1-epoch GIN smoke train with fixture data to validate training.
2) Run a GNN predict smoke against the smoke run to validate inference.
