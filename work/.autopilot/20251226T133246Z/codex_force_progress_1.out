Marked Task 020 as verified by checking the acceptance criteria and recording the contract test run, and refreshed the queue metadata to reflect the latest update in `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md` and `work/queue.json`. This keeps the task state consistent with the completed artifact contract implementation and verification.

- Checked the acceptance criteria and added a verification note in `work/tasks/020_artifact_contract_impl.md`.
- Updated the `updated_at` timestamp in `work/queue.json` to reflect this change.

Tests run:
- `pytest tests/contract/test_artifacts_contract.py` (pass)

Next steps (optional):
1) Run a full train → predict → evaluate flow to confirm on-disk artifact layout under `runs/`.
2) If you want, I can also run the broader test suite or a smoke set.
